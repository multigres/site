# Contributing

We are focused on getting the project to a stable state and then we will open it up to contributions.

For smaller contributions, such as documentation fixes, please open a pull request. You will need to follow instructions in the [GitHub Workflow](/docs/github-workflow) document.

## Ideas and Feature Requests

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/discussions) to share your ideas and feature requests.

## Bug Reports

[Open an issue](https://github.com/multigres/multigres/issues) on GitHub. Include reproducible information and any relevant error messages.

# Site contributions

You can make site contributions at this [Github repository](https://github.com/multigres/site). As mentioned above, please follow the [GitHub Workflow](/docs/github-workflow) document.

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed when a Pull Request is merged into the `main` branch.
