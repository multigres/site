# A Generalization of Consensus Protocols - part 2

## Building the foundation

In [part 1](/consensus/consensus-part-01), we redefined consensus as a solution to two fundamental problems:

1. **Distributed Durability** - ensuring requests are saved elsewhere before acknowledgment
2. **High Availability** - enabling quick recovery and resumption after failures

Now, let's build the conceptual foundation by establishing the basic components and constraints of a consensus system.

## The Basic Model

A consensus system consists of:

- **Nodes**: Independent processes that can store data and communicate with each other
- **Requests**: Units of work that need to be durably stored
- **Network**: Communication medium between nodes (unreliable, can experience delays or partitions)
- **Storage**: Persistent storage on each node (can fail independently)

## Key Constraints

Before we can design a solution, we must acknowledge the constraints we're working within:

### Failure Modes

Any component in the system can fail:
- **Node failures**: Processes can crash and restart
- **Network failures**: Messages can be delayed, lost, or reordered
- **Storage failures**: Data can be corrupted or lost

### The CAP Theorem Reality

We cannot have all three of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance simultaneously. In a consensus system:
- We prioritize **Consistency** (correctness)
- We strive for **Availability** when possible
- We must tolerate **Partitions** (network failures are inevitable)

## The Core Challenge

Given these constraints, how do we ensure that:
1. A request is never lost once acknowledged?
2. The system can recover from any failure?
3. All nodes eventually agree on the same sequence of requests?

In the next part, we'll explore the fundamental mechanism that makes this possible: **quorums**.

Stay tuned!
